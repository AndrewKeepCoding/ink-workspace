# Ink Workspace and Ink Workspace Pro

Welcome to the official issue-only repo for Ink Workspace and Ink Workspace Pro. The apps are desktop apps that replace built-in Windows Ink Workspace in Windows 10. Apps primarily use WPF and UWP (as XAML Islands) and allow you to run installed apps, sketch notes and capture screen or windows.
